# ids-ne-lakes

New folders created for data (in and out) and scripts (py, json, R)

Added renv package management for 'future me' to not get frustrated with package updates that break code.

This repository is currently using GitLFS for the Sunapee temp .csv file


Notes on scripts/data:
Json script is for GEE, which produces the skin temp csv, filter script is what connects with BGS files
